<h1> About my homepage</h1>

<h2>Welcome!</h2>
This website was created for fun by me, K3CAN. Everything you see is written by hand, from scratch, in straight HTML4.  
<p>It's styled after "homepages" and websites of the early 2000s, a period of fundamental evolution of the World Wide Web. 
<p>The modern web is jammed full of scripts, trackers, and code written almost entirely by specialized software.
This page is a reflection of a time when webpages were typed out, by hand, letter by letter, tag by tag. 

<p>I used <a href="https://www.biega.com/HTMLQuick1.html">Bill Biega's website</a> for reference, as it's been a while since I've played with html tags. Appropriately enough, his page is dated from 2003 (last updated 2012) and still maintians its 2000's styling. </p>

<p>All HTML was written using the Bluefish editor. </p>
