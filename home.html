<p>I gained an interest in radio communication when I was a teenager, and installed a CB radio in my first car. </p>

<p>My father, N3CAN, an amateur radio operator since the early 80s, eventually convinced me to make the move to amateur radio.</p>

<p>After gaining my technician class license,  My crowning achievement was a 600 mile, straight-key 25w CW contact on 10m, with a homemade key. </p>

<p>The next year, I upgraded to General class and managed to just barely get a 40m dipole into the air on my tiny plot of land. I expanded into phone and digital on HF, and also made the jump to newfangled "digital" modulations. I generally monitor Talk Group 98003, 31075, and 98006 and the Wires-X room 28941. </p>

<p>On the World Wide Web, you might find me surfing the r/amateurradio subreddit.</p>

<p>You can send me an "electronic QSL" via LOTW or QRZ.com, or you can send me snail-mail for a paper QSL card.	</p>
